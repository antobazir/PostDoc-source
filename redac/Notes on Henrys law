henry's law links : 
concentration in [M] = [mol/dm³] = 
partial pressure p in atm or Pa 

For oxygen in water Sander reports : 
1.3*10⁻³ mol/L/atm at 25°C

1.3*10⁻³*exp(-1700*(1/310-1/298))

Through Van't Hoff law : H =  1.6212e-3 mol/L/atm at 37°C assuming cells are made entirely of water

->  1.6212e-3 mol/L/atm = 2.133e-6 mol/L/mmHg

2.133e-6 mol/dm³/mmHg -> 2.133e-3 mol/m³/mmHg -> 2.133e-3 mM/L/mmHg  ou 468.82 mmHg/mM

-> 0.16/2.133e-3

1 atm = 760 mm Hg
1 Pa = 0.00750 mmHg= 7.50e-3 mmHg
