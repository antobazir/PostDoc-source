**Cytoplasmic p53 couples oncogene-driven glucose metabolism to apoptosis and is a therapeutic target in glioblastoma
-"Glucose, glutamine, and lactate measurements

Cellular glucose consumption and lactate production were measured using a Nova Biomedical BioProfile Basic Analyzer. Briefly, cells were plated in 1 × 10$^5$ cells/ml in 2 mL of gliomasphere conditions and appropriate drug conditions. 12 hrs following drug treatment, 1 ml of media was removed from each sample and analyzed in the Nova BioProfile analyzer. Measurements were normalized to cell number." NOT ATTACHED
-0.006 nmol/cell/12hr -> 8.33 fmol/min/cell -> 4.15 mM/min (GBM39)

**In vitro expansion of U87-MG human glioblastoma cells under hypoxic conditions affects glucose metabolism and subsequent in vivo growth
-Growing U87-MG cells at either 3 or 21 \% O 2 has no
significant impact on cell doubling time calculated,


**Metabolic Alterations in Highly Tumorigenic Glioblastoma
Cells
- Glucose uptake was measured using [ 3H]2-deoxyglucose,
 en CPM donc on peut rien dire
 
 **High Glucose Promotes Human Glioblastoma Cell Growth by Increasing the Expression and Function of Chemoattractant and Growth Factor Receptors
- ON va p'tet pousser le délire sur les U87 vu qu'il y a pas mal de mesure...
- en 6 jours de culture on passe de moins 1e5 à 15e5 en normoxie () et seulement 2.5e5 en hypoxie

**A New Pathway Promotes Adaptation of Human Glioblastoma Cells to Glucose Starvation
-entre 100 et 80 mg/dl/1e6 c (décroît au cours du temps et plus vite dans les sphéroïdes que dans les cellules adhérentes (passe de 100 à 90 ou de 100 à 80 en 8hr)
-U-87 MG, Hu-197, C6 and HeLa cells were grown in DMEM/F12 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with 10\% FBS, 100 unit/mL penicillin, 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin and 8 μg/mL ciprofloxacin and passaged once they were reaching confluence
-glucose consumption and lactate release into the cell culture medium were measured at the appropriate times by collecting 300 μL of medium from the cultures
- 100 mg/dl/1e6

Dans S1 on a l'uptake 
- on passe 0 à 30 mg/dl/10^6 en 8hr
- 3.75 mg/dl/1e6 c/hr ->  0.021 mmol/dl/1e6 c/hr
Bon je pige pas...


**Multinuclear NMR Studies of an Actively Dividing Artificial
Tumor
-"For glucose consumption measurements, 7e7 A549 cells grown on 100 mg of CultiSphers were removed from spinner culture and placed in an NMR perfusion chamber, as described above."
-" 70 mg of 1-13C-glucose dissolved in 3 ml of glucose-free medium were added
through a 0.22 μm sterilization filter to the 50 ml of medium, resulting in 7.8 mM glucose. " 
- approx 1 mM en 200 mn
- 1 mmol/L * 53e-3 L -> 1e-3*53e-3 -> 53 µmol pour 70 millions de cellules en 200 mn -> 0.0038 µmol/min/million cell -> 3.8 nmol/min/million cell -> 3.8 fmol/min/cell -> 3.8 mM/min

**Bevacizumab and CCR2 Inhibitor Nanoparticles Induce Cytotoxicity-Mediated Apoptosis in Doxorubicin-Treated Hepatic and Non-Small Lung Cancer Cells 
-"Glucose consumption level using Huh-7 and A549 cancer cells were measured upon different nano-treatments and their free counterparts using glucose detection kit. Briefly, the cells were cultured in 96-well plates at a density of 1×10e4 cells/well. In the second day, 5 mM of glucose and different nano-treatments and their free counterparts were added in the media after 2 hours of cells starvation. "
-"Glucose Consumption Rate of A549 and Huh-7 Cancer Cells upon AV, CR, AVNP, CRNP, and DOX+AVCRNP. Mean and standard error (n=3) were represented in the blot. The used concentrations over cells were as follow: 0, 25, and 100 (μM for AV and DOX, and nM for CR). The cells were incubated with the drugs for 24 h"
- well volume 400 µL (working volume 350 µL max)
- 5.5 mM en 24 hr dans 300-350 µL  avec 10000c -> 1.65 à 1.92 µmol par 24hr pour 10 000 c 
- 11 pmol/min/c 
- 57 mM/min... c'est beaucoup...

**The diagnostic value of lower glucose consumption for IDH1 mutated gliomas on FDG-PET
-"Glucose assay
Cells in logarithmic growth phase with good growth status were taken and inoculated into 6-well plates(1 to 3 mL) with 4e5 cells per well. 3–4 multiple Wells were set in each group. After continuous culture for 1 Day, cell glucose consumption was detected, according to the kit operation method (GAHK20, Glucose (HK) Assay Kit)."
-24 hr and 1mg/mL in  U251 wt
- 1 mg/mL -> 5e-3 mmol/mL -> 5 mmol/L -> 10 µmol en 24hr avec 400000 cell
-25 pmol/cell en 24hr -> 17 fmol/min/cell -> 8.5 mM/min
