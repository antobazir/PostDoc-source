** Targeting Glucose Metabolism of Cancer Cells with Dichloroacetate to Radiosensitize High-Grade Gliomas Cook 2021
-"Like many other solid malignant tumors, HGGs preferentially use aerobic glycolysis to uptake and convert glucose into lactate. This altered glucose metabolism not only enables tumor cells to use glucose-derived carbons for the synthesis of essential cellular ingredients, but it also rapidly provides ATP to fuel cellular activities. In addition, this metabolic shift contributes significantly to treatment resistance including resistance to radiotherapy (RT) "
-"It is now thought that the Warburg effect gives HGG cells an advantage by supporting rapid cell proliferation and survival [21]"
-"Mitochondrial and glycolytic ATP production was observed to be a 1:1 ratio of OXPHOS to glycolysis among some individual primary GSC lines, while others heavily favored glycolysis and lactate production and are therefore more responsive to glycolytic inhibition"
-" Hypoxic HGG cells are unable to survive if they are glutamine starved "

**Targeting tumor hypoxia and mitochondrial metabolism with anti-parasitic drugs to improve radiation response in high-grade gliomas Mudassar 2020
- "An enhanced rate of aerobic glycolysis suggests that cancer cells should have a decreased rate of OXPHOS; however, current research increasingly suggests that along with glycolysis, some cancers also rely on mitochondrial biogenesis and OXPHOS for energy production and in vivo progression [52, 53]. "
- "Vlashi et al. 2011 observed that unlike differentiated glioma cells, GSCs are less glycolytic and predominantly reliant on mitochondrial function and OXPHOS, producing large amounts of ATP [62]."


**Glutaminolysis: A Hallmark of Cancer Metabolism
-"Currently, a widely accepted theory is that aerobic glycolysis can accumulate abundant glycolytic intermediates that are shunted into de novo synthesis of nucleotides, nonessential amino acids, and fatty acids (5). Furthermore, higher glycolytic rates support faster ATP generation compared with glucose oxidation in the TCA cycle (10). In cancer cells in which enzymatic expression of pyruvate kinase isoform 2 (PKM2) is found to be high, the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) into pyruvate is slower than in cells with high PKM1 expression. This leads to the accumulation of pyruvate precursors, which are driven into branch pathways such as the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), the lipid biosynthesis pathway, or amino acid synthesis."
-" Glutamine is the most abundant circulating amino acid in blood and muscle. Several decades ago, investigators discovered that glutamine consumption rates in HeLa cells are 10 to 100 times greater than those of other amino acids (14). High glutamine consumption has been discovered in many cancers, including pancreatic, ovarian, and breast cancers (15–17). This finding has also been confirmed clinically; plasma glutamine concentration within different tumors is significantly lower than in healthy subjects (18, 19)."

- "With αCD95, an ATP loss >70\% (i.e., a residual ATP concentration of <0.5 nmol x mg prot−1) was invariably followed by necrosis (Fig. ​(Fig.3,3, b and c)"
-residual ATP above 50\%) changed the mode of cell
death from necrosis to apoptosis

**Current Insights Into Oligodendrocyte Metabolism and Its Power to Sculpt the Myelin Landscape
"Metabolic pathways largely fall into three distinct categories: anabolic, catabolic, or waste disposal. Anabolic pathways are a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions that require energy inputs and carbon backbones to synthesize complex macromolecules such as proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids, whereas catabolic reactions ultimately produce energy by sequential degradation of large molecules into their smaller constituents: proteins into amino acids, carbohydrates into sugars, and lipids into fatty acids. Waste disposal mechanisms remove toxic byproducts and, together with total cellular metabolism, help to coordinate the optimal energetic balance needed for all cellular activities"

**Cellular Metabolism and Disease: What Do Metabolic Outliers Teach us
-la figure 1 est très bien pour comprendre le rôle de chaque processus

** Metabolic Reprogramming in Brain Tumors
- "The two principal nutrients that cancer cells use are the sugar glucose and the amino acid glutamine. These two nutrients are central to many anabolic processes including the biosynthesis of ATP, nucleotides, proteins, and lipids (1–3)."
-"increased glycolysis may seem wasteful from a perspective of ATP generation, but it contributes to the generation of biomass for the proliferation and growth of cancer cells."
-"Secreted lactate alters the microenvironment and enables tumors to adapt to hypoxia"
-" Recent results from our lab and other groups have demonstrated that glioma cells primarily use fatty acids as a substrate for energy production."
-"While glioma cells clearly rely upon fatty acids for energy production, it is not clear whether they acquire fatty acids from the bloodstream or build these carbon chains themselves."

**The Biology of Cancer: Metabolic Reprogramming Fuels Cell Growth and Proliferation
-Quiescent cells (left) have a basal rate of glycolysis, converting glucose (glc) to pyruvate (pyr), which is then oxidized in the TCA cycle. Cells can also oxidize other
substrates like amino acids and fatty acids obtained from either the environment or the degradation of cellular macromolecules. As a result, the majority of ATP
(yellow stars) is generated by oxidative phosphorylation

**The Rate of Oxygen Utilization by Cells
-Explains the whole thing gr protein and so on (THANK GOD)
-So it requires the protein mass per cell (GREAT) but it's in the range 100-1000 pg for all tested cell lines.
-"At concentrations of oxygen used in most mammalian cell culture (e.g. ≈182 μM in air-saturated media with 5 \% CO2, 37 °C, sea level)"
-"These examples have changes that range from 1.5- to a 5-fold increase in OCR. Interestingly, cells in lag phase apparently can in some circumstances consume oxygen at rates greater than when in exponential growth. A process that occurs during lag phase is adjustment of the extra cellular redox environment [63, 64, 65]. Adjusting the redox status of extra cellular thiols would require considerable flux through the pentose cycle and thus a large demand for ATP and possible need for dioxygen. However, the OCR in different phases of the cell cycle and growth needs more detailed studies to provide clear knowledge of these associations." important

**Glucose consumption in recurrent glioma 
the overall consumption can vary a lot in patient with some over 6 while other below 2 but most are above 2

**Les mesures d'Alessandro et de Shen sont cohérentes !

"The Multifaceted Contributions of Mitochondria to Cellular Metabolism"
-  Glutamine anaplerosis sustains TCA cycle intermediates in conditions of limiting glucose and MPC inhibition, demonstrating the potential flexibility of these metabolic nodes.34,35
- Palmitate, a 16-carbon fatty acid (FA), stores 39KJ/g of energy compared to 16KJ/g stored in glucose.49 Therefore, FAs are a major source of cellular energy, particularly under conditions of nutrient stress. 
-Beyond toxicity, ROS are potent mitogen signaling agents that foster proliferation, differentiation, and migration.123,142 Specifically, ROS oxidize cysteine residues, linking mitochondria to signaling cascades. 

**Fatty acid oxidation is required for the respiration and proliferation of malignant glioma cells
- "Fatty acid chains can be used to produce energy within a growing tumor;6 prostate and breast cancer cells in particular have been specifically shown to employ fatty acid oxidation as a metabolic strategy.7,8 Etomoxir, an inhibitor of fatty acid oxidation, has been shown to decrease oxygen consumption rates (OCRs) and impair ATP and NADPH production in the pediatric glioblastoma cell line SF188.9"
- "  In this report, we show that fatty acid oxidation is in fact the primary catabolic pathway in human glioblastoma cells (hGBMs) maintained under such optimal culture conditions. Blocking this pathway reduces cellular respiratory and proliferative activity."
-"Therefore, excess glucose utilization, as predicted by the Warburg effect, may not be particularly characteristic of gliomas."

**Metabolism and Brain Cancer
- " Another important reason for the cancer cells to switch to aerobic glycolysis is to provide metabolic macromolecules for the daughter cells. 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements show that 90\% of glucose and 60\% of glutamine are converted into lactate or alanine by GBM cell cultures.50 Although each lactate excreted from the cell wastes three carbons that might otherwise be utilized for either ATP production or macromolecular precursor biosynthesis, the tumor cells choose this method to fasten carbon incorporation into biomass to increment cell division velocity. Glutaminolysis also generates reductive power required for fatty acid biosynthesis by NADPH production via the activity of NADP+-specific malate dehydrogenase (malic enzyme), in addition to the fundamental role in replenishing the TCA cycle.51"
- "An important penalty for this increased flux of macromolecules to provide biomass for the proliferating cancer cells not converted to aerobic glycolysis is also an increase in mitochondrial OXPHOS, the major source of ROS production. Elevated mitochondrial ROS formation frequently occurs upon suppression of pyruvate input into OXPHOS.75"

**Ten-fold Augmentation of EndothelialUptake of Vascular Endothelial Growth FactorWith Ultrasound After Systemic Administration

When HIF1a and HIF1b expression was measured in cultured
HeLa cells from 0% to 20% oxygen, a maximal response was found
at 0.5% oxygen with a half maximal expression at 1.5–2% oxygen;
expression was significantly low above 4% oxygen, 38 confirming
that HIF1 is active in the required range to control physiological
responses to oxygen deprivation (discussed further below).
